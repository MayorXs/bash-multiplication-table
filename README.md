# bash-multiplication-table
Capstone project: Bash script that generates multiplication tables (full/partial) using loops and conditional logic.

# Bash Multiplication Table Script

## 📌 Project Summary
This project is a **Bash shell script** that generates multiplication tables interactively.  
It demonstrates the use of **variables, loops (list form & C-style), user input, conditionals, and validation**.  
The script enhances user experience by offering full or partial tables, ascending/descending order, and repeat execution.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use variables to store user inputs and use them in calculations.
- Learn the syntax and use cases of both list form and C-style `for` loops.
- Practice using loops to automate repetitive tasks, such as generating a multiplication table.
- Enhance the script's interactivity and user-friendliness by incorporating user input and clear output formatting.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Generates multiplication table using **list form loop**.
- Generates multiplication table using **C-style loop**.
- Option for **full table (1–10)** or **partial table (custom range)**.
- Handles **invalid ranges gracefully** (falls back to full table).
- Option for **ascending or descending** order.
- Option to **repeat script execution until user exits**.
